## OTU Processing Steps

### Dependencies:

1. Miniconda3 (for installing python and packages)
2. Python 3.7.3
3. numpy 1.16.3
4. pandas 0.24
5. pyyaml 5.1
6. biopython 1.73
7. R 3.5.1
8. dada2 1.11.1
9. fastqc 0.11.8
10. scikit-bio-0.5.5
11. deicode 0.2.2
12. seaborn-0.9.0
13. seqmagick-0.7.0
14. infernal 1.1.2
15. taxtastic 0.8.11
16. raxml 8.2.12
17. pplacer 1.1.alpha19


### Process:

1. In `otu_scripts` there is a file called `config.yml`. Fill this out first.
2. Make sure paths are correct in the `*skeleton.sh` files in `utility_scripts`
3. Make sure your trimming parameters are set in the `TrimmingParams.tsv` file
4. Run `python prepSSnMakeJobs.py` to create batch files for each library
5. Run all filter scripts that were created to trim your libraries
	* _Note: The demultiplexing scripts are specific to data from our lab_
6. Review the FASTQC reports & quality plots in `otu_data/trim_stats`
7. Run OTU calling scripts to infer sequence variants
8. Confirm that `seqtab_chim.rds` files exist in `otu_data/dada2_outputs`
9. Enter file paths for each `.rds` in a CSV file like `otu_data/seq_tabs.csv`
10. Confirm that desired taxonomic databases are on disk
11. Edit `mergeRunandTaxa.sh` to point to your input files and DBs and run.
12. Confirm that TSVs with abundances and taxa are in `dada2_outputs`
13. Run the steps in `make_tree_1.sh` to create a reference tree for `pplacer`
14. Run `make_tree_p2.sh` to remove low quality sequences
15. Run `make_tree_p3.sh` to place sequences on a tree
16. Run `cluster_asv_table.sh` to make centroids
17. Use [MAFFT server](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/large.html) to make alignment and trees.
17. Run `Preliminary_OTU_Table_Analysis` to make first batch of figures
